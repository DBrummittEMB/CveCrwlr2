Character Choice Screen:
	- Currently has 2 buttons to choose from 2 different characters. Modify to show both character choices and thier starting stats. Also an image of each. the stats should probably be in a new array similar to how monsters are handled. Potentially many characters could be created with different starting equipment and stats and images.

Stats Screen:
	- Modify to properly show stats laid out int 2 collumns. The first section will be an image of the character the player chose along with the current stats (hp/hp, gold, strength, etc.). The next section will contain stats such as:
		- a list of monsters killed and how many
		- Total damage done
		- Total clicks
		- Total number of fights
		- Gold earned
		- Gold spent

Inventory System/Store Overhaul:
	- Inventory screen will show a list of all the items the player has. There will be three subscreens, one for useable items and one for equipable items, and one for misc or story items. Useable items are health potions or similar. Equipable items is for armor and weapons. The last category is for items that don't fit in the other two categories. Things like an item required to unlock a new location, or an item that will teleport the player to a hidden boss fight when they get 3 of them or something like that.
	-The store will have to be overhauled to account for items other than weapons. There will need to be some way to determine what is for sale at the store, whether that is random or related to game progress. the player should be able to choose from a selection of items. The player should be able to sell any of thier items. The item the player starts with should be changed to 'fist' to represent not having a weapon and instead of telling the player not to sell their only weapon tell them they have no weapons.
	- The inventory management system will also need to be rehauled.

Leveling System:
	- Design and implement a system for leveling up.

Score System:
	- Design and implement a system for keeping score.

Text Outputs:
	- Current outputs to the player are very generic. Figure out the 'flavor' of the game and write good text outputs wherever appropriate.

Dynamic U.I. Updates:
	- Set up event listeners for automatic U.I. updating, most likely using the 'update' event. Set up the U.I. to update reflecting the choice of characters.
	- Should be mostly done, double check for universal implementation.

Combat:
	- New combat system needs to be designed and implemented. This will include new stats. Add a use magic button to choose from spells. Possibly a context menu for attack to choose from attacks. Add a button to use items.
	- Add a red slash image across the monster when the player hits.
