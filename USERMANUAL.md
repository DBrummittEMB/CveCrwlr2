## Cave and Combat
In the cave you can fight **small** or **medium** monsters. The **Fight Boss** button on the
hub starts a battle with a boss.

During combat:
 - **Attack**: damage the enemy based on your strength and weapon. Attacks can miss if the
   enemy's agility is higher than yours or if both combatants have no agility.
- **Use Item**: consumes a health potion if you have one in your inventory.
- **Run**: flee back to the town square.
- Defeating monsters grants gold and experience. When experience reaches the requirement
  for the next level, your level increases automatically.
- If your health drops to zero you lose and can restart from the home screen.

## Inventory and Equipment
The inventory screen lists all items you own. Items are grouped by type and show thumbnails:
- **Weapons** and **Armor**: increase your attack or defense when equipped.
- If no armor is equipped, you receive no bonus defense.
- **Accessories**: provide passive bonuses and stack with other gear.
- **Consumables**: one-use items such as health potions.

## Tips
- Save gold for weapon and armor upgrades before attempting tougher monsters.
- Visit the store after battles to heal and manage inventory.
- Keep an eye on your experience bar; leveling up increases your strength.
- Agility makes you harder to hit and improves your accuracy in combat.

Enjoy exploring the world of CveCrwlr and strive to defeat the final boss!
